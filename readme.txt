#FPGA implementation of Complex-valued Neural Network for MNIST image classification 
CVNN and RVNN folders contain the FPGA implementation code for Complex and Real Valued Neural Network with Polar represented MNIST Images. 

Python folder contains the python code for cartesian to polar representation of MNIST images. This also inlcude the cvnn and rvnn model implemented by python using this https://github.com/NEGU93 library.
